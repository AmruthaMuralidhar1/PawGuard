# PawGuard
PawGuard is an advanced IoT-based solution that combines multiple sensors, machine learning, and real-time mobile app notifications to create a smart road safety system. It aims to improve road safety by detecting stray animals in the vehicle’s path and alerting both the driver and nearby pedestrians through an integrated network. The system not only triggers an immediate alert to the driver but also provides real-time location tracking, prediction of high-risk zones, and allows for crowd-sourced animal reporting to help build safer roads.

Multi-Sensor Detection System:

IR Sensors & Cameras: Mounted at the front, back, and sides of the vehicle, infrared sensors and thermal cameras will detect animals based on heat signatures. Cameras will feed into an AI-driven model that can classify and detect animals in real-time, even under low-light conditions.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Placed on the vehicle’s perimeter to detect animals at greater distances. This can provide earlier warnings for the driver, especially in rural or low-visibility areas.
AI-Powered Animal Recognition:

Machine Learning Algorithms: Using the data from cameras, the system can differentiate between animals and other obstacles, and identify the type of animal (e.g., cattle, dogs, wild animals). AI can help prioritize alerts based on the size and proximity of the animal to the vehicle.
Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms will analyze past data to predict high-risk zones (e.g., areas with frequent animal sightings) and inform the driver in advance.
Real-Time Driver Alerts:

In-Vehicle Alerts: When an animal is detected, the system will trigger an immediate in-vehicle alert, which could be an audible buzz, visual indicator on the dashboard, and a notification on a connected mobile app.
Automatic Braking Assistance: The system can be linked with the car’s braking system (for vehicles that support such integration) to automatically slow down or stop the vehicle when a high-risk animal is detected in close proximity.
Mobile Application Integration:

Mobile Alerts: The app will show live updates on animal detection, display the animal’s location, and provide options for the driver to toggle alerts on/off.
Emergency Response: If an accident occurs, the app can alert local animal rescue teams and authorities with the animal’s location to help ensure a quick response.
Crowd-Sourced Reporting: Users can report sightings of stray animals on the app, contributing to a shared database of animal hotspots. This can help other drivers prepare for high-risk areas.
Route Prediction: The app can suggest safer routes based on historical data, traffic conditions, and known animal crossing zones.
Animal Movement Management:

Animal Geofencing & GPS Collars: Attach GPS collars to stray animals in high-risk areas to track their movement and trigger alerts when they enter roadways. This information can be shared with local authorities and animal rescue groups.
Physical Barriers and Deterrents: Integrate with road infrastructure solutions like ultrasonic deterrents or motion-sensing lights that trigger when an animal approaches a dangerous area.
Cloud-Based Data Analytics:

Centralized Data Collection: All vehicle data (including animal detections, locations, and driver feedback) will be collected in a cloud-based platform. This will help local authorities and animal protection groups track animal migration patterns and focus on high-risk road sections.
Insights and Reporting: The platform will generate reports on animal-related accidents, providing insights into locations and times of frequent incidents, helping authorities improve road safety measures.
Community Awareness & Involvement:

Public Education: A feature on the app could include educational resources for communities to better understand the dangers of stray animals on roads and ways to help prevent accidents.
Local Animal Safety Campaigns: Partnering with local governments to install physical deterrents (e.g., road signs, reflective markers) in identified high-risk zones.
